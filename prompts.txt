1 - how to test the yolo and then effnet then maskrcnn. we did not label the data yet. is there way to test the pipeline without trained data. know nothing about those models. we are trying to do our research which is on microplastic detection. the same filter paper with microplastics as fibers, films, fragments are phtographed using microscopes and then the same using mobile macro lens. we use micro images to validate positions of microplastics in macro images. we use image stitching and already built it here for stitch macro images to make full filter paper macro image so we can label it. then label those micro and macro images (don't know whether it is necessary to label micro images too). then export it from label studio. go through this yolo - maskrcnn - effnet pipeline. and end product should give capability to give microplastic stats of the inputed macro images (Don't know wheteher its is necessary to detect those in micro images too. but there is no way to stitch thise images because many images need to cover the full filter image). currently i have 10 samples of filter images with micro and macro photose of thise. now tell me how i can check the pipeline without training all data.
